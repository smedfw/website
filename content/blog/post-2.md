Each year our industry sets a special day aside to demonstrate the power and
promise of manufacturing to the next generation of engineers and practitioners
(Although the SME DFW Chapter strives to do this everyday!).

This day is called [Manufacturing Day](https://www.mfgday.com/) or MfgDay for
short. This year, MfgDay was October 5th.

Some chapters hold plant tours. Others host talks and presentations. Others still
invite high school and university students into their places of business to show
the ins-and-outs of what makes manufacturing the most creative field in existence.

While these are great engagement strategies, our chapter chose to do something
different. We partnered with the [SME Virtual Network](https://smevirtual.com/)
to launch two virtual presentations and a [showcase website](https://mfgday.smevirtual.com/).

If you get an opportunity, I would highly recommend that you check out
[our Manufacturing Day website here](https://mfgday.smevirtual.com/).

The website itself is open-source as is available on the
[SME Virtual Network GitHub page](https://github.com/smevirtual/mfgday18-website).

The videos will remain available **indefinitely** on YouTube. The website will
remain active until next year when we will try to top what we have started this
year.

## Engagement Results

Our chapter measures engagement and participation for all events. The SME requires
us to submit these engagement metrics to national every year to demonstrate
our progress.

Our engagement metrics during each event were the following:

[Introduction to Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Sp9N0zUfwc)

**Showtime:** 12pm CST

**Webinar Length:** 80 minutes

**Views:** 12

**Total Watch Time:** 480 minutes (40 minutes/view average)

[Manufacturing Fundamentals for Students and Makers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IUBTa_F5js)

**Showtime:** 6pm CST

**Webinar Length:** 82 minutes

**Views:** 5

**Total Watch Time:** 232 minutes (46.4 minutes/view average)

Not bad for our first year since becoming active again (and we really only
started in August)!

The beauty of hosting virtual events on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/smevirtual)
is that our events are always available and searchable by even those who may
not have heard of SME before - thus increasing our chapter's impact globally.

Therefore, the figures above are the minimums because more and more people will
happen across our chapter events as time goes on.

## Future Plans

Next year, we hope to partner once again with the SME Virtual Network as this
broadcasts the great work our chapter is starting to do in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area to a much broader audience.

Additionally, we hope to explore ways of incorporating local businesses into
a hybrid event where local SME DFW members can participate physically, but
members which are not in the Dallas-Fort Worth area can still join us from
the comfort of their own homes and offices.

Also, feel free to share [your ideas with us for next year](https://goo.gl/forms/qut4cYyM1LTPWleP2).

Be creative! Nothing is off the table!

Manufacturing Day **2019** will be held on October 4, 2019.
