Welcome to the SME DFW Chapter (and our new website)!

First, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Adam Cook. I one of three
Transition Committee Members for the SME DFW Chapter. The other members at the
time of this writing are:

- [Sunshine Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunshine-smith2018/)
- [Artemio (Art) Palos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artemio-palos-2528942b/)

The SME DFW Chapter is a non-profit organization which serves engineering
and manufacturing professionals, students and businesses in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area.

If you are not familiar with SME (formerly known as the Society of Manufacturing
Engineers), check out their [homepage](http://www.sme.org/).

One of the key challenges for a physical chapter or group nowadays is competing
with the ubiquitous nature of the Internet. Busy professionals and students
may no longer feel that it is necessary to participate in physical engagements
so long as they can receive occasional professional cultivation via Internet
Forums, Wiki pages, social media and blogs.

In many ways this is true - the Internet is a powerful competitive force for
chapters, but instead of fighting it, this chapter will embrace it while also
evolving its value proposition to encourage growth and an enriching experience
for the community.

Moreover, for students especially, it is important to remember that manufacturing
is still a very physical business. As opposed to the more "virtual" nature of
technology-oriented businesses, manufacturing is powered mostly by physical
relationship building, interactions with physical supply chains and physical
product production on the floor.

Speaking of technology and the Internet, manufacturing too is evolving in exciting
ways. Big Data, Machine Learning, IIoT and Cloud Computing are transforming
businesses and business models. Although these technologies are in their early
days, they are already making positive returns for many companies.

However, for engineers, vastly different skill sets are needed to take advantage
of the professional growth opportunities in these new fields - and these skill
sets are in **high** demand by employers.

## Chapter Value Proposition

After several years of inactivity, the SME DFW Chapter has a renewed focus and
commitment to the manufacturing community of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Below
is a summary of where we are today and where we plan to go in the future.

This chapter will only be as successful as the value that we offer the community,
as well as, your constant [feedback](https://goo.gl/forms/qut4cYyM1LTPWleP2) in
terms of your interests and comments on our progress.

Future Engagement Plans for 2019:

- We are currently in talks to host a workshop at [HOUSTEX](https://houstexonline.com/) in February.
- Establish a local Certificate Program for Industry 4.0 training in partnership with the [SME Virtual Network](https://smevirtual.com/).
- Launch an annual, chapter-sponsored Industry 4.0 Hackathon at area universities.
- Broaden our support for area high-schools with digital training workshops and hands-on activities.
- Participate in at least two (2) local outreach activities to introduce the chapter to the public.
- ...and [your suggestions](https://goo.gl/forms/qut4cYyM1LTPWleP2)

## Local Venue Help

The SME DFW Chapter, being a predominately physical experience for members, needs
more physical venues in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

**Venue identification is one of the most difficult aspects of running a chapter.**

We have big plans and we need your help. If you can potentially host chapter
events, please complete [this quick form](https://goo.gl/forms/tWpYiXHm1wxH2JwS2)
and we will be in touch shortly.

Thank you for your consideration!

## Transition Committee

We would like to grow the number of Transition Committee members for the chapter
to at least 5 members (currently we are at 3).

**If you have a passion for working and supporting your local manufacturing and
engineering community, please consider joining us!**

The following are the minimum requirements for Transition Committee Members:

- You are a current SME member in good standing.
- You have not held a SME chapter leadership position in the past 3 years. This is to allow some fresh members the chance to lead.
- You live or work in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
- You have the ability to give time to this effort. Most of the time, it will require a couple of hours per week. For special events, the time commitment may be more.

If you meet this criteria and would like to put your hat in the ring, please
[contact us](https://goo.gl/forms/qut4cYyM1LTPWleP2).
